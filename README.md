## Usage

As the app is now running on your computer inside a docker image, open your browser

Create a *.json* file by copy and pasting the following code, and save it on your computer

**Only use the following structure/layout.**
**Do not change the structure/layout in any way.**

**Do not change the keys. The keys are before the ':' .**

example: "load", "fuels","gas", "powerplants", "name",..

**Do not change all the values. Values are after the ':'**

example: "500", "13.4", "460", "gasfired", "tj1,..

**Only the VALUES of the following keys can be changed: "load", "wind", "gas", "kerosine", "co2", "efficiency", "pmin", "pmax"**

```json
{
  "load": 500,
  "fuels":
  {
    "gas(euro/MWh)": 13.4,
    "kerosine(euro/MWh)": 50.8,
    "co2(euro/ton)": 20,
    "wind(%)": 100
  },
  "powerplants": [
    {
      "name": "gasfiredbig1",
      "type": "gasfired",
      "efficiency": 0.53,
      "pmin": 100,
      "pmax": 460
    },
    {
      "name": "gasfiredbig2",
      "type": "gasfired",
      "efficiency": 0.53,
      "pmin": 100,
      "pmax": 460
    },
    {
      "name": "gasfiredsomewhatsmaller",
      "type": "gasfired",
      "efficiency": 0.37,
      "pmin": 40,
      "pmax": 210
    },
    {
      "name": "tj1",
      "type": "turbojet",
      "efficiency": 0.3,
      "pmin": 0,
      "pmax": 160
    },
    {
      "name": "windpark1",
      "type": "windturbine",
      "efficiency": 1,
      "pmin": 0,
      "pmax": 150
    },
    {
      "name": "windpark2",
      "type": "windturbine",
      "efficiency": 1,
      "pmin": 0,
      "pmax": 36
    }
  ]
}
```


Write the following address inside your browser 
```
http://localhost:8888/productionplan
```

Click on "Browse" in the select a file box
